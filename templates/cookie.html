                    <p style="color: #212529; font-style: italic;">The Cookie Clicker Automation project uses Python and
                        Selenium WebDriver to automate the process of playing the famous browser game, Cookie Clicker.
                        The script interacts with the game's interface, simulating mouse clicks to collect cookies and
                        purchase upgrades. The goal is to maximize the number of cookies in the shortest possible time
                        by automating the clicking and purchasing actions, creating an efficient gaming strategy.</p>

            <!-- Explanation of the Code -->
            <h2 class="spacer-h3">Explanation of the Code</h2>
            <h3 class="spacer-h3">main.py</h3>
            <ul class="spacer">
                <li><strong>WebDriver Setup:</strong> The script uses Selenium to open the Cookie Clicker website,
                    selecting the English language and loading the main game screen.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Game Loop:</strong> The loop runs continuously, clicking the big cookie to generate cookies
                    and periodically checking if it is time to purchase new upgrades such as cursors, grandmas, and
                    farms.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Upgrade Purchases:</strong> The script calculates the cost of each upgrade and buys them
                    when the player has enough cookies. It purchases the most cost-effective upgrades in the correct
                    order to maximize cookie generation.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Cookie Generation:</strong> The script simulates mouse clicks on the big cookie to generate
                    cookies, ensuring the player‚Äôs progress continues without manual input.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <!-- Gameplay Mechanics -->
            <h2 class="spacer-h3">Gameplay Mechanics</h2>
            <ul class="spacer">
                <li><strong>Game Loop:</strong> The script runs the main game loop, constantly clicking the cookie and
                    checking if upgrades should be purchased.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Upgrade Priority:</strong> The script buys upgrades based on their price and the player's
                    available cookies. For example, the script purchases the cheapest available upgrade first to
                    maximize progress.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> The automated clicks and purchases improve the player's performance
                    over time, allowing them to progress without manual input.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <!-- How I Developed the Game -->
            <h2 class="spacer">How I Developed the Game</h2>
            <p style="color: #212529; font-style: italic;">I built this automated Cookie Clicker script as a project
                through the 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023. It was a great opportunity to
                practice Python and Selenium WebDriver. I learned how to interact with dynamic web pages, locate
                elements, and simulate user input programmatically. By automating the process of clicking and
                purchasing, I was able to experiment with strategies to optimize gameplay.</p>

            <p style="color: #212529; font-style: italic;">Additionally, I gained hands-on experience with WebDriver's
                waiting mechanisms and element interaction, as I used these techniques to control the flow of the
                game.</p>

            <!-- Conclusion -->
            <h2 class="spacer">Conclusion</h2>
            <p style="color: #212529; font-style: italic;">This project helped me enhance my Python and Selenium skills
                by automating the gameplay of a popular browser game. The process of building the script provided
                valuable insight into web scraping and automating browser-based interactions. In addition, it was a fun
                and practical way to apply programming concepts like loops, conditionals, and element selection.</p>
