                    <p style="color: #212529; font-style: italic;">This Turtle Crossing Game project was implemented
                        using Python and the Turtle module. The game features a player-controlled turtle that moves up
                        the screen and attempts to avoid moving cars that randomly appear. The goal is to reach the
                        finish line at the top of the screen, where the level will increase, and the speed of the cars
                        will increase as well. If the player collides with a car, the game ends. The project includes a
                        scoring system that tracks the player's level, and the game resets when a collision occurs.</p>

            <!-- Explanation of the Code -->
            <h2 class="spacer-h3">Explanation of the Code</h2>
            <h3 class="spacer-h3">main.py</h3>
            <ul class="spacer">
                <li><strong>Turtle Screen Setup:</strong> The screen is created with specific dimensions of 600x600
                    pixels and uses the <code>Screen</code> class from the <code>turtle</code> module. The screen
                    updates every 0.1 seconds using the <code>screen.tracer(0)</code> method.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Game Loop:</strong> The main game loop runs continuously, updating the screen and
                    controlling the movement of the cars and the player. The player can control the turtle using the
                    'Up' arrow key to move it upwards.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Collision Detection:</strong> If a car's distance from the player is less than 20 pixels,
                    the game ends, and a "Game Over" message is displayed.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Leveling Up:</strong> When the player reaches the finish line, their score is incremented,
                    and the player’s position is reset to the starting position. At the same time, the car speed is
                    increased to make the game more challenging.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="spacer">car_manager.py</h3>
            <ul class="spacer">
                <li><strong>Car Creation:</strong> The <code>CarManager</code> class is responsible for creating the
                    cars. It uses a random number generator to decide when a car should appear and sets random positions
                    for the cars along the Y-axis.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Car Movement:</strong> Each car moves towards the left of the screen at a constant speed,
                    and their movement is controlled by the <code>car_move</code> method.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Increasing Car Speed:</strong> As the player progresses, the speed of the cars increases by
                    a defined amount with each level.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="spacer">player.py</h3>
            <ul class="spacer">
                <li><strong>Player Setup:</strong> The player is represented by a turtle with a starting position at
                    <code>(0, -280)</code>. The turtle moves upwards when the player presses the 'Up' key.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Finish Line Detection:</strong> The player’s goal is to reach the top of the screen, at
                    which point the <code>is_at_finish</code> method returns <code>True</code>, signaling the player has
                    reached the finish line.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Resetting Player Position:</strong> If the player reaches the finish line, they are moved
                    back to the starting position.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="spacer">scoreboard.py</h3>
            <ul class="spacer">
                <li><strong>Scoreboard Setup:</strong> The <code>Scoreboard</code> class tracks the player's level,
                    which is displayed at the top of the screen. The score updates when the player reaches the finish
                    line.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Increasing Score:</strong> The score increases by 1 each time the player reaches the finish
                    line.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Game Over:</strong> When the player collides with a car, the game ends, and the "GAME OVER"
                    message is displayed at the center of the screen.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <ul class="spacer">
                <li><strong>High Score Storage:</strong> This text file stores the highest score achieved in the game.
                    It’s read and written by the <code>Scoreboard</code> class to persist the high score between game
                    sessions.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="spacer-h3">Gameplay Mechanics</h2>
            <ul class="spacer">
                <li><strong>Game Setup:</strong> The game initializes with a screen size of 600x600, with the player
                    (turtle) represented by a turtle object and the cars represented by square shapes. The player's goal
                    is to avoid cars and reach the finish line to level up.
                </li>
                <li><strong>User Input:</strong> The player controls the turtle using the 'Up' arrow key. The turtle
                    moves upwards with each press of the 'Up' key.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Car Movement and Speed:</strong> Cars are generated at random Y-positions and move from
                    right to left. As the player progresses, the speed of the cars increases.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Game Over:</strong> The game ends if the turtle collides with a car, and the player is shown
                    a "GAME OVER" message.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <!-- How I Developed the Game -->
            <h2 class="spacer">How I Developed the Game</h2>
            <p style="color: #212529; font-style: italic;">I gained hands-on experience with Python through the 100 Days
                of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023. I implemented this Turtle Crossing Game as a
                practical project to understand object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts. I created classes for the
                player, cars, and scoreboard, which made the game logic modular and easier to manage.</p>

            <p style="color: #212529; font-style: italic;">This project helped me break down the game into smaller,
                manageable parts. The Player class interacts with the CarManager to avoid collisions, while the
                Scoreboard tracks the player’s progress and updates the score. Encapsulation was key, as each class
                handles its own functionality, such as controlling the player’s movement or adjusting the cars’
                speed.</p>

            <p style="color: #212529; font-style: italic;">I used the Turtle graphics module to visually represent
                the player, cars, and game elements. Additionally, I utilized the random module to generate cars at
                different Y-positions and control their speed as the game progressed, ensuring a dynamic and engaging
                player experience.</p>

            <!-- Conclusion -->
            <h2 class="spacer">Conclusion</h2>
            <p style="color: #212529; font-style: italic;">This Turtle Crossing Game is a fun project that helped me
                practice core programming concepts in Python, including classes, functions, and handling user input. The
                game has simple yet engaging mechanics, and the increasing difficulty makes it challenging to play. I
                used the Turtle module to create an interactive and visual experience, and I enjoyed implementing file
                handling to track the high score.</p>
