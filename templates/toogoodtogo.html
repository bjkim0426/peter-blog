                    <p style="color: #212529; font-style: italic;">The 2Good2Go Bot automates the process of reserving
                        food deals through the TooGoodToGo app. Using Python, Appium, and Selenium WebDriver, the script
                        interacts with the app's user interface to quickly identify when items become available,
                        automatically attempts to reserve them, and handles the checkout process. The goal is to reduce
                        the time it takes to secure high-demand items, increasing the chances of successfully completing
                        a reservation.</p>

            <h2 class="spacer-h3">Explanation of the Code</h2>
            <h3 class="spacer-h3">main.py</h3>
            <ul class="spacer">
                <li><strong>WebDriver Setup:</strong> The script uses Appium to connect to an iOS device through the
                    specified device UDID. It then initializes the Appium driver with the appropriate capabilities to
                    interact with the TooGoodToGo app.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Item Availability Check:</strong> The main function continuously checks for the availability
                    of items by monitoring the screen for the "Reserve" button and pop-ups that indicate an item has
                    sold out. Once an item is available, it attempts to click the "Reserve" button.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Popup Handling:</strong> If a pop-up appears indicating that the item is unavailable, the
                    bot detects it and closes the pop-up before continuing the search.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Checkout Process:</strong> After successfully reserving an item, the bot proceeds through
                    the checkout process, clicking "Got it" to acknowledge the prompt and automatically increasing the
                    quantity of items. Finally, the bot triggers the "Buy with Apple Pay" button, leaving the final step
                    for manual confirmation.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <!-- Gameplay Mechanics -->
            <h2 class="spacer-h3">Script Mechanics</h2>
            <ul class="spacer">
                <li><strong>Item Reservation: </strong> The bot continuously checks for item availability, simulating
                    clicks on the "Reserve" button once an item becomes available.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Popup Handling:</strong> If an item is not available and a "Sold Out" pop-up appears, the
                    bot closes the pop-up and retries until an item is successfully reserved.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Checkout Process:</strong> The script automates the checkout by interacting with the
                    interface, including increasing item quantities and triggering the payment process. The final
                    confirmation requires manual user input.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> The automated process speeds up the userâ€™s ability to secure
                    reservations for high-demand food items, increasing the chances of success by automating repetitive
                    tasks.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <!-- How I Developed the Game -->
            <h2 class="spacer">Why I Developed the Bot</h2>
            <p style="color: #212529; font-style: italic;">The TooGoodToGo app is a platform where businesses list
                unsold food items that are made that day before closing, aiming to reduce food waste. My sister-in-law
                was disappointed by the availability of a popular restaurant's offerings, which were often listed at a
                good value but sold out very quickly. She mentioned that she suspected others were
                using a bot to reserve the items, as they were consistently sold out within minutes of being listed.</p>

            <p style="color: #212529; font-style: italic;">Hearing this sparked my curiosity, and I decided to develop a
                customized bot specifically for her. After creating the bot, her success rate of reserving the
                items went from about 5% to an impressive 99.99%. It was exciting to see how automation could improve
                her chances and reserve the items she wanted, all while reducing the time and effort required
                to secure the best deals!</p>
            <!-- Conclusion -->
            <h2 class="spacer">Conclusion</h2>
            <p style="color: #212529; font-style: italic;">This project not only sharpened my skills in Python,
                automation, and web scraping, but it also showed me the practical impact of technology in solving
                real-world problems. The bot I created for my sister-in-law drastically improved her chances of
                successfully reserving a popular food item on the TooGoodToGo app, transforming her experience from
                frustration to success. This project reinforced the importance of efficiency and automation in todayâ€™s
                fast-paced digital world.</p>

            <p style="color: #212529; font-style: italic;">Through this experience, I gained a deeper understanding of
                how automation tools like Selenium and Appium can be used to simplify complex tasks, and Iâ€™m excited to
                apply this knowledge to future challenges. Whether itâ€™s improving productivity, creating user-friendly
                solutions, or exploring new opportunities, this project reinforced my passion for problem-solving
                through coding.</p>
