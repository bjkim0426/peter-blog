                        individual with a solid grasp of object-oriented programming, I am dedicated to ongoing growth within
                        the Software Development Life Cycle. I have a proven ability to lead and contribute to intricate
                        projects, continually advancing my skills through proactive learning and teamwork.</p>

            <p>My interest in coding was sparked by my brother-in-law, a software engineer, and my wife, who holds a
                master's degree in data science. The first programming language I learned was Python, through the
                freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel. After grasping the basics of Python, I enrolled in the 100 Days of
                Code bootcamp taught by Dr. Angela Yu on Udemy, where I deepened my knowledge of Python. Completing the
                course, I realized how much I enjoyed coding, especially the ability to bring my software ideas to life.
                This passion led me to pursue a career in computer science, and Iâ€™m excited to continue developing my
                skills and contributing to innovative projects.</p>
